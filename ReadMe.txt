Trying to learn Selenium
I recommend downloading the Selenium IDE plug in for Firefox,
then you can mix recording and export it to C# and then program you test.
Note that IE requieres a special driver. 
See http://www.seleniumhq.org/ for more information. 
Can also recommend pluralsights course on selenium.
